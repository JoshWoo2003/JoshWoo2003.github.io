I'm a third year undergraduate student at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science and Technology (Top-notch Program). My research interest includes Machine learning system, high perfomance computing and distributed system. 

Currently, I'm a remote intern in [Ds<sup>2</sup>Lab](https://ds2-lab.github.io/) at [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) advised by [Prof. Yue Cheng](https://tddg.github.io/). I used to be a research assistant in [Dicalab](http://www.dicalab.cn/) at [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/) advised by [Prof. Qing Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jLoTsBYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao)

I am a highly self-motivated undergraduate eagerly seeking admission to a Ph.D. program.

### Layer-wised Sparsification Based on Hypernetwork for Distributed NN Training
*Team Lead, Supervised by Qing Ye (Sichuan University)*
![pic1](../images/Layer-wised_Sparsification_Based_on_Hypernetwork_for_Distributed_NN_Training.png)
* Proposed a layer-wised sparsification method which utilizes hypernetworks to narrow down the communication volume. 
* Constructed an efficient objective function for the hypernetwork to guide the selection of layers for transmission, ensuring that layers which contribute more to the learning process are prioritized to transmit.
* Conducted extensive experiments on different models and datasets. The results validate the efficacy of our method and demonstrate its compatibility with other current compression techniques (e.g., TernGrad, Top-K).
* Outcome: (1<sup>st</sup> author) A research paper accepted by ICANN2024.
