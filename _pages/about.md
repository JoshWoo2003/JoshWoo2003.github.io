### Layer-wised Sparsification Based on Hypernetwork for Distributed NN Training
*Team Lead, Supervised by Qing Ye (Sichuan University)*
![pic1](../images/Layer-wised_Sparsification_Based_on_Hypernetwork_for_Distributed_NN_Training.png)
* Proposed a layer-wised sparsification method which utilizes hypernetworks to narrow down the communication volume. 
* Constructed an efficient objective function for the hypernetwork to guide the selection of layers for transmission, ensuring that layers which contribute more to the learning process are prioritized to transmit.
* Conducted extensive experiments on different models and datasets. The results validate the efficacy of our method and demonstrate its compatibility with other current compression techniques (e.g., TernGrad, Top-K).
* Outcome: (1<sup>st</sup> author) A research paper in submission.
